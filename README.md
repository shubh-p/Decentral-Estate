- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (Frontend Framework)

## DATA PROCESSING

We have developed two smart contracts: one to oversee escrow transactions and one to control the 
properties in order to deploy our decentralised real estate application. A unique non-fungible 
token (NFT) that adheres to the ERC-721 standard will be used to represent each property on 
the blockchain network. The NFT that represents the property is placed into an escrow account 
when a user wants to purchase it, where it is approved by the miners before being funded by 
the buyer. Once the deal is complete, the buyer acquires ownership of the asset or NFT from 
the seller. The non-fungible ERC-721 token smart contract is in charge of validating and 
moving tokens across wallet addresses.

## INPUTS REQUIRED:
In order to use our real estate platform, customers must first create a crypto wallet. This is 
critical since all transactions will take place in digital currencies.
## THE PLATFORM'S OPERATION
Users will interact with the website, and the website's backend will interact with the smart 
contracts. Smart contracts are code-based contracts that may be programmed to run 
automatically when specific criteria are satisfied. The blockchain network will host these 
contracts, and the website will connect with them to facilitate real estate transactions.
## APPLICATION OF IPFS
The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) will be used to maintain the metadata and properties of 
individual non-fungible tokens (NFTs) distributed on the blockchain network. IPFS is a peerto-peer protocol that enables file storage and access across a distributed network of computers. 
We can use IPFS to ensure that NFT metadata and properties are stored decentralised and 
securely, making it difficult for anyone to modify the data.
